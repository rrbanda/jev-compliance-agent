"""Cross-border data-policy router — orchestrator and root agent definition.

Evaluates a data-processing request against a registry of regional Agent
Cards (`app/policy/cards.py`) using a data-residency/jurisdiction policy
engine (`app/policy/engine.py`), then delegates to whichever regional
processor sub-agent the policy approved.
